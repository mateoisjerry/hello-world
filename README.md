# hello-world

You cannot love me
I am a dandelion seed
Born, I begin beautiful
In death, I am all that is not

Yes, but at one point you did sprout
Came into being, named and were

In living, you satisfied around you
To the insects which thrived
Born, like you, in hardship
You gave all that you could
Offered to be the bearer to many

And in dying you were born again
A contempter of death, you prevailed
You gave birth to tens of others
Gave life back to Her
To whom She expected nothing in return
It was you who paid back the debt

What you say is not true
I can love you, for you are all that is

Most radiant being
Looking upward at the morning sky
My love, my life
My Dandelion seed
